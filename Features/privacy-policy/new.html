		<h1 class="center-wrapper">Information we collect and how we use it</h1>
		<h5>General</h5>
		<p>We only collect personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis. We do not require that you provide this information to gain access to our site, and we do not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably needed to participate in an activity on our site. However, if you do not provide the information that is noted as being required or mandatory in connection with a particular activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity. We collect personally identifiable information primarily to e-mail updates and news, to respond to your questions or suggestions, and to complete online transactions. We do not sell any information we gather at our web site to anyone outside of ScienCell Research Laboratories. We do not transfer or disclose any information we gather at our web site to anyone outside of ScienCell Research Laboratories without your prior consent, except (1) in cases where we believe in good faith that we have a legal obligation to disclose such information, and (2) to certain suppliers that assist ScienCell in maintaining and managing the activities on its web site. Please be assured that these suppliers are legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and do not acquire any rights to use your information for their own benefit. We may share non-identifiable aggregate information about our users with business partners and other third parties in an effort to customize or enhance the content and advertising on our site for our users.</p>
		<p>We do reserve the right, in connection with the potential sale or transfer of the interests of ScienCell and its subsidiaries and affiliates, to sell or transfer your information (including but not limited to your address, name, age, gender, zip code, state, and country of residency and other information that your provide through other communications) to a third party entity that (1) concentrates its business in a similar practice or service, (2) agrees to be ScienCell’s successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of the information collected, and (3) agrees to the obligations of this privacy policy.</p>
		<h5>Online Purchasing</h5>
		<p>When you order from us on our web site we collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect this and other information, in order to fill your order and to communicate with you about your order. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use. If you do not provide the information that is noted as being required or mandatory, you will not be able to place orders on our web site.</p>
		<h5>Cookies</h5>
		<p>Like many companies, we use a technology called “cookies” to enhance your experience on our web site. “Cookies” are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which the web server is then able to retrieve from the web browser when you visit other pages of our web site or you subsequently visit our web site. ScienCell uses these cookies for a number of purposes, such as saving information about your country (if applicable), authenticating registered users, supporting the mechanisms for our shopping cart and on-line ordering, and enabling general traffic trend analysis. The cookies ScienCell uses do not contain any personally identifiable information and can not profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. You are not identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you come to our site.</p>
		<p>While you do not need to allow your browser to accept cookies in order to browse much of our web site or to access many of our services, you must have cookies enabled if you wish to access content in languages other than English, shop on-line at our web store, or access any areas reserved for registered users.</p>
		<p>Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. As described above, turning off the cookie function will restrict the on-line services from ScienCell that you can use.</p>
		<h5>Security</h5>
		<p>We employ appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For our e-commerce activities, we employ software, which encrypts information you input, as an additional security measure. However, as no on-line data transmission can be guaranteed to be totally secure, we (like all web sites) cannot warrant or guarantee 100% security of any information you transmit to us at our web site.</p>
