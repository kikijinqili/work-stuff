<p>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a gene complex located on the short arm of human chromosome 6. The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which helps the immune system distinguish host cells from invaders. It is the most polymorphic locus in the human genome, and has been implicated in many pathologies including autoimmunity disorders and cancer.</p>

<p>ScienCell offers a series of GeneQueryâ„¢ HLA PCR+Sanger SBT Typing Kits to genotype 6 HLA genes, HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, and -DRB1. These kits utilize the Sequence-Based Typing (SBT) method, which is the gold standard for HLA typing. The Sanger sequencing results can be analyzed by SOAPTyping software (BGI). The two haplotypes from both parents can be typed simultaneously using these kits and the SOAPTyping software.</p>

<p>In addition, ScienCell offers HLA genotyping service using these kits. Typing results will be delivered in the format of 4-digit genotypes (e.g., HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*25:01).</p>
