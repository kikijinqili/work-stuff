        <h1>HLA Typing Kits & Service</h1>
        <p>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a gene complex located on the short arm of human chromosome 6.
            The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which helps the immune
            system distinguish host cells from invaders. It is the most polymorphic locus in the human genome, and has
            been implicated in many pathologies including autoimmunity disorders and cancer.</p>

        <p>ScienCell offers a series of GeneQueryâ„¢ HLA PCR+Sanger SBT Typing Kits to genotype 6 HLA genes, HLA-A, -B,
            -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, and -DRB1. These kits utilize the Sequence-Based Typing (SBT) method, which is the gold
            standard for HLA typing. The Sanger sequencing results can be analyzed by SOAPTyping software (BGI). The two
            haplotypes from both parents can be typed simultaneously using these kits and the SOAPTyping software.</p>

        <p>In addition, ScienCell offers HLA genotyping service using these kits. Typing results will be delivered in
            the format of 4-digit genotypes (e.g., HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*25:01).</p>
