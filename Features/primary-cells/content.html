        <p>With cutting-edge technologies and stringent standard of quality control, ScienCell is proud to provide
            researchers with over 260 types of reliable, high quality primary cells from 24 normal human and animal
            systems including nervous, cardiac, hepatic, renal,gastrointestinal, pulmonary, mesenchymal, adipose, oral,
            ovarian, prostate, hair, lymphatic, skeletal, mammary, umbilical, urethral, ocular and more, many of which
            are unique to the industry.</p>
        <p>Primary cells differ from immortalized cell lines by limited population doubling. Without genetic and
            chemical modifications, primary cells retain many of the important physiological properties of their origin
            tissue systems and closely mimic the <em>in vivo</em> conditions. They, therefore, offer ideal cell models
            for a vast variety of research, from fundamental cell biology and physiology, developmental biology, disease
            mechanisms, to drug screening and therapeutics development.</p>
        <p>Using methods exclusive to ScienCell, our primary cells are isolated from healthy human and animal tissues,
            cryopreserved at early passage with outstanding cell viability. We also provide customized cell isolation
            services, cell-derived DNA, RNA and proteins. Select from the Category below to see what primary cell
            products ScienCell offers.</p>
