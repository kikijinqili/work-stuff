<p>With cutting-edge technologies and stringent standard of quality control, ScienCell is proud to provide researchers
    with over 260 types of reliable, high quality primary cells from 24 normal human and animal systems including
    nervous, cardiac, hepatic, renal,gastrointestinal,&nbsp;pulmonary, mesenchymal, adipose, oral, ovarian, prostate,
    hair, lymphatic, skeletal, mammary, umbilical, urethral, ocular and more, many of which are unique to the industry.
</p>
<p>Primary cells differ from immortalized cell lines by limited population doubling. Without genetic and chemical
    modifications, primary cells retain many of the important physiological properties of their origin tissue systems
    and closely mimic the&nbsp;<em>in&nbsp;vivo</em>&nbsp;conditions. They, therefore,&nbsp;offer&nbsp;ideal cell models
    for a vast variety of research, from fundamental cell biology and physiology, developmental biology, disease
    mechanisms, to&nbsp;drug screening and therapeutics development.</p>
<center>
    <p>Using methods exclusive to ScienCell, our primary cells are isolated from healthy human and animal tissues,
        cryopreserved at early passage with outstanding cell viability. We also provide&nbsp;customized cell isolation
        services, cell-derived DNA, RNA and proteins. Select from the Category below to see what primary cell products
