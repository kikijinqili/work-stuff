				<h3>2. Glossary</h3>
				<h5>Adherent Cultures</h5>
				<p>Cultures of cells that are attached to a natural or artificial substrate. Often referred to as monolayer
					cultures, but may be expanded to include multilamellar cultures.</p>
				<h5>Cell Culture</h5>
				<p>Growth of cells dissociated from the parent tissue by spontaneous migration or mechanical or enzymatic
					dispersal.</p>
				<h5>Cell Strain</h5>
				<p>A characterized cell line derived by selection or cloning.</p>
				<h5>Confluent</h5>
				<p>Where all the cells are in contact all around their periphery with other cells, and no available
					substrate is left uncovered.</p>
				<h5>Differentiation</h5>
				<p>A term implying irreversible loss of the specialized properties that a cell would have expressed in vivo.
					As evidence accumulates that cultures "differentiate" by a combination of selection of undifferentiated
					cells or stromal cells and deadaptation resulting from the absence of the appropriate inducers, this
					term is going out favor. It is still correctly applied to progressive loss of differentiated morphology
					in histological observations of, for example, tumor tissue.</p>
				<h5>Explant</h5>
				<p>A fragment of tissue transplanted from its original in vivo location and maintained in vitro in a
					nutrient medium.</p>
				<h5>Medium</h5>
				<p>A mixture of inorganic salts and NUTRIENTS capable of sustaining cells survival in vitro for a 24 hours
					period. Growth medium, A medium that supplies the nutrients necessary for sustained in vitro cellular
					proliferation. Maintenance medium, A medium that will support cell survival and limited biological
					function but not sustained proliferation.</p>
				<h5>Organ Culture</h5>
				<p>The maintenance or growth of organ tissues which supports differentiation and preservation of normal
					tissue architecture or function.</p>
				<h5>Organ</h5>
				<p>A composite of tissues with defined structure and function.</p>
				<h5>Passage</h5>
				<p>Successful transposition of cells from an original culture container to another culture vessel;
					synonymous with subculture.</p>
				<h5>Population Doubling</h5>
				<p>The interval required by a cell population to double in density (or concentration). Example: one week
					after seeding a T-75 flask with the standard inoculum of 7.5 X 10<sup>5</sup> cells, the harvest
					contained 6.0 X 10<sup>6</sup> cells. The population doublings is calculated by the formula Nh/Ni =
					2<sup>x</sup> (where Nh = cell harvest number, Ni = cell inoculum number, ad X = the number of
					population doublings). Then, 6.0 X 10<sup>6</sup> cells/7.5 X 10<sup>5</sup> cells = 2<sup>x</sup>, or
					log (6 X 10<sup>6</sup>) - log (7.5X<sup>5</sup>) = X log 2. Therefore, X = 3.</p>
				<h5>Primary Culture</h5>
				<p>A culture started from cells, tissue, or organs taken directly from an organism and before the first
					subculture.</p>
				<h5>Seeding Efficiency</h5>
				<p>The percentage of the inoculum that attaches to the substrate within a stated period of time (implying
					viability, or survival, but not necessarily proliferate capacity).</p>
				<h5>Split Ratio</h5>
				<p>The divisor of the dilution ration of a cell culture at subculture, e.g., one flask divided into four or
					100 ml up to 400 ml would be a split ratio of 4.</p>
				<h5>Subconfluent</h5>
				<p>Less than confluent. All of the available substrate is not covered.</p>
				<h5>Substrate</h5>
				<p>The matrix or solid underlay upon which a monolayer culture grows.</p>
				<h5>Suspension Cultures</h5>
				<p>Cultures of free-floating cells not attached to substrate. Suspension requires agitation provided by
					mixing, stirring, spinning, or sparging. Suspension cultures may be monodisperse (single cell) or
					aggregated (clusters).</p>
				<h5>Tissue Culture</h5>
				<p>Properly, the maintenance of fragments of tissue in vitro but now commonly applied as a generic term to
					include tissue explant culture, organ culture, and dispersed cell culture, including the culture of
					propagated cell lines and cells strains.</p>
				<h5>Tissue</h5>
				<p>An aggregate of cells of the same type.</p>
